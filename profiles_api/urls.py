# The third argument going to be used for retrieving the URLs in our router

    path('', include(router.urls))  # as you register new routes with our router it generates a list of URLs that are
    # associated for our viewset it figures out the URLs that are required

    # The router generates multiple URLs for the resources which are registered to it. For example router.register(
    # 'feed', views.UserProfileFeedViewSet) will register multiple URLs like: /api/feed, /api/feel/:id. After
    # everything is registered to a router, you can get all urls at router.urls. The include() function is used to
    # include multiple URLs. So essentially all that line does it include URLs for everything that's registered to a
    # router.
